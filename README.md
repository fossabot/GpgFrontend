# GPG Frontend

GPGFrontend is a modern, easy-to-use, compact, cross-platform, and installation-free gpg front-end tool. By using
GPGFrontend, you can quickly encrypt and decrypt text or files. Or at the same time as the above operations, you can add
your own signature to let others know that this document or this paragraph of text was issued by you.

Furthermore, it visualizes most of the common operations of gpg commands. It aims to allow ordinary users to quickly use
gpg and make professional users more convenient. GPGFrontend supports some new features of OpenPGP.

# Features
- No need to install.
- GPGFrontend can run on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Just double-click, and then you can use it freely.
- Before use, you only need to install gnupg. A tool of a few MB.
- GPGFrontend supports multiple languages.

How to Use it
---------

0. Install gnupg. To check if it is installed, you can enter gpg on the command line.
1. Unzip gpgfrontend.zip. The compressed package can be downloaded in Release.
2. Start GpgFrontend with gpgfrontend.exe or gpgfrontend (depending on your os).

Purpose
-----
The GPGFrontend project inherit from a relatively mature but not maintained gpg4usb project. It inherits the stable,
easy-to-use, compact, and installation-free features of gpg4usb, and plans to support some new features of OpenPGP based
on it and continue to improve it.

GPGFrontend will add more functions in the future to improve the ease of use of GPG in end-to-end transmission. At the
same time, the addition of new functions does not affect the old basic functions. My personal strength is always
limited. GPGFrontend welcomes volunteers to join. You can use the GitHub platform to file an issue, or submit a pull
request.

The GPGFrontend project is as open source, and it also insists on using open source codes and libraries.


Obtaining
---------
You can get the available binary files of the project and the compressed package of its dependent resources in the
release, and double-click to use it after decompression.

How to Build it
---------

The tutorial for building the software will be released shortly.
